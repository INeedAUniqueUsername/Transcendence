				The docking bay swarms with activity. Techs hook up

				Benedict and the abbess talk with the freighter's captain.

				"...the Penitents hit them hard," says the captain.
				"There was no trace of the explorer ship; we just found
				her drifting in space. She must have ejected..."

				Behind them you see cardinal-robed medics maneuver a
				rejuv tank through the bay. Inside you see an unconscious
				woman, her long black hair waving in the tank's fluid.

				Benedict looks across the docking bay at the rejuv tank

				"That's Fiona. I should have never let her go," he says, mostly to himself.

				"Penitents attacked her patrol ship, just as she
